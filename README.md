### Raw Data Processing and Alpha Diversity
Raw 16S data processed using mothur v.1.48.3. Pipeline adapted from mothur MiSeq SOP, https://mothur.org/wiki/miseq_sop/. 

**Required File for Sequence Processings**
- SILVA database (release 138.2) obtained from: https://mothur.org/wiki/silva_reference_files/
- PDS reference files (version 19) obtained from: https://mothur.org/wiki/rdp_reference_files/


### Beta Diversity Analysis
Shared file from mothur was converted into a Phyloseq object (using the "make phyloseq.R" script). Beta diversity and differential taxa analysis were conducted with R and RStudio version 2024.04.2+764. Primary packages include Phyloseq, vegan, and ggplot2. All packages are listed in the corresponding R scripts.
